# Spline Interpolator

The Spline is a mathematical piecewise function. The intervals where the function is defined between points specified by the user. The curve between those points is smooth thanks to a intorpolation. 

In this project I implemented a graphical interface for the spline.

## Getting Started

In this section I will explain how to run and build the program.

### Prerequisites

You need to install the `ant` dependencies manager.

In **macOS** you can install `ant` by running.

```
brew install ant
```

### Installing

After having `ant` installed you can run the command:

``` 
ant
```
So it is going to generate the file `jar/SplineInterpolator.jar`.

To run the program you just double-click on the `.jar` file.
